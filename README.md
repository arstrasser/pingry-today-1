# Pingry Today OLD

This is the old version (2016) of the Pingry Today app. It was coded in Ionic 1 with AngularJS, but then was upgraded to Ionic 5 with Angular. The new version of the app can be found in the private [Pingry Today 2 Repository](https://github.com/arstrasser/pingry-today-2). Please contact me for permission to access the new repo, there is just sensitive code that cannot be released publicly.

This code repository is just an example of what the original code looked like (and to contrast with the significantly nicer Pingry Today 2 code).

Feel free to look through and see a little of how the app used to look.
